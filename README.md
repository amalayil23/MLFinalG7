# MLFinalG7
Machine Learning Final Project

In this project, we utilized many different prediction 
models to analyze the dataset on water potability. 
These prediction models include Gaussian Naive 
Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
Deep Neural Network, and an Ensemble model.
